# honeybee-core
Honeybee core library.

# NOTE

This repository will be renamed to `honeybee` once the current `honeybee` repository is
renamed to `honeybee-radiance`.

## What is this repository?

This repository is the core library for honeybee which is mostly geometry.

In most cases you will use this library with one or more honeybee plugins like
`honeybee_radiance`, `honeybee_energy`, etc.). These plugins extend honeybee's
functionalities to export honeybee geometries to different simulation software.
